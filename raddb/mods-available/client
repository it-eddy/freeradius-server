# This module loads RADIUS clients as needed, rather than when the server
# starts.
#
#  There are no configuration entries for this module.  Instead, it
#  relies on the "client" configuration.  You must:
#
#	1) link raddb/sites-enabled/dynamic_clients to
#	   raddb/sites-available/dynamic_clients
#
#	2) Define a client network/mask (see top of the above file)
#
#	3) uncomment the "directory" entry in that client definition
#
#	4) list "client" in the "authorize" section of the
#	   "client' virtual server.  The default example already
#	   does this.
#
#	5) put files into the above directory, one per IP.
#	   e.g. file "192.0.2.1" should contain a normal client definition
#	   for a client with IP address 192.0.2.1.
#
#  For more documentation, see the file:
#
#	raddb/sites-available/dynamic-clients
#
#
#  The module also supports maps and the %{client:...} expansion.
#
#  map client [<ipaddr>] {
#	Tmp-String-0 := 'nas_type'
#	Tmp-String-1 := 'shortname'
#	Tmp-String-3 += 'groups'	# Creates multiple attributes from custom group attribute associated
#					# with the client.
#  }
# 
#  "%{client:nas_type}"			# Expands to client's nas_type (or "" if nas_type not set)
#  "%{client:<ipaddr>.nas_type}"	# Expands to the specified client's nas_type (or "" if nas_type not set or
client {

}
